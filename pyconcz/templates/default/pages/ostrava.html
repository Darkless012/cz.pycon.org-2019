            <h2>About</h2>

            <h3>Get to know the real city!</h3>
            <p>Ostrava is great in its own way: it’s city with cosy cafés and decent prices. It’s an amazing alternative if you look for a walk in the middle of the “black city”, a city full of industrial heritage and heaps of slag. Of course, the buildings are being reused now, revamped by modern architects and in continuous change. The city went through a lot of modernisation in the past few years and luckily almost every day there’s a new place opening: galleries, cafés, bars or bistros. The city is not crowded with tourists so you can experience an authentic post-industrial city. If you want to pay us a compliment, come up with other advantages of Ostrava. Such as Sorela architecture, parks with fountains and typical plane trees, and statues of shining future for working men and women. Here is a short video called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IigB6tA82w0">Iron city</a> which gives you a snapshot of Ostrava architecture, culture and leisure activities.</p>

            <p>How did Ostrava gain its charismatic industrial fluidum?</p>
            <p>Nicknames of the city of Ostrava are “Black Ostrava” or “steel heart of the Republic”. Amazing, isn’t it? The names come from the time when the city was covered by pollution from ironworks. The most important thing – Ostrava was truly built around one factory, and only a few buildings were there before that. However, after the beginning of coal industry and start of business with iron and steel, the city was build one factory next to another, a mine next to mine, colonies of houses next to colonies of houses. If there was no factory, there would be no city. The unspoiled dominant feature of Ostrava is the Vítkovice area, the Hlubina mine complex and the blast furnaces and the ironworks coke plant and was placed on the list of tentative UNESCO World Heritage Site.</p>

            <h3>Ostrava and history</h3>
            <p>You can find foundations of Ostrava in the middle of the Masaryk square. The old city hall from the 14<sup>th</sup>century was turned to the Ostrava Museum. But we built this city mostly in the 18<sup>th</sup> and 19<sup>th</sup> century when the great story of industrial revolution began. As the main centre of production of coal, coke, iron and steel in central Europe we can see Ostrava as a unique industrial complex because it is the only area in Europe where we can find such a technological flow in one place. The heart of the city is the Lower Vítkovice (DOV), known as Dolní Vítkovice. Blast furnaces and other unique machines are placed there. Walking towards the housing part of Vítkovice to Mírové náměstí, you can find houses, a nursery, a hospital and an old cafeteria and other social buildings build in the 19<sup>th</sup> century by Salomon Mayer von Rothschild after the year 1828. We can find products from Vítkovice in Paris – Eiffel Tower, or Australia’s biggest bridge.The production in this place ended in 1998. Since 2007, it has been reused for education, culture, art, conferences and expos, as well as concerts and parties or sports events. Nowadays, Ostrava is known for cultural events, festivals and sports events.</p>
