            <h2>Ostrava</h2>

            <h3>Get to know the real city!</h3>
            <p>Ostrava is great in its own way: it‚Äôs city with cosy caf√©s and decent prices. It‚Äôs an amazing alternative if you look for a walk in the middle of the ‚Äúblack city‚Äù, a city full of industrial heritage and heaps of slag. Of course, the buildings are being reused now, revamped by modern architects and in continuous change. The city went through a lot of modernisation in the past few years and luckily almost every day there‚Äôs a new place opening: galleries, caf√©s, bars or bistros. The city is not crowded with tourists so you can experience an authentic post-industrial city. If you want to pay us a compliment, come up with other advantages of Ostrava. Such as Sorela architecture, parks with fountains and typical plane trees, and statues of shining future for working men and women. Here is a short video called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IigB6tA82w0">Iron city</a> which gives you a snapshot of Ostrava architecture, culture and leisure activities.</p>

            <h3>How did Ostrava gain its charismatic industrial fluidum?</h3>
            <p>Nicknames of the city of Ostrava are ‚ÄúBlack Ostrava‚Äù or ‚Äústeel heart of the Republic‚Äù. Amazing, isn‚Äôt it? The names come from the time when the city was covered by pollution from ironworks. The most important thing ‚Äì Ostrava was truly built around one factory, and only a few buildings were there before that. However, after the beginning of coal industry and start of business with iron and steel, the city was build one factory next to another, a mine next to mine, colonies of houses next to colonies of houses. If there was no factory, there would be no city. The unspoiled dominant feature of Ostrava is the V√≠tkovice area, the Hlubina mine complex and the blast furnaces and the ironworks coke plant and was placed on the tentative list of UNESCO World Heritage Centre.</p>

            <h3>History of Ostrava</h3>
            <p>You can find foundations of Ostrava in the middle of the Masaryk square. The old city hall from the 14<sup>th</sup>century was turned to the Ostrava Museum. But we built this city mostly in the 18<sup>th</sup> and 19<sup>th</sup> century when the great story of industrial revolution began. As the main centre of production of coal, coke, iron and steel in central Europe we can see Ostrava as a unique industrial complex because it is the only area in Europe where we can find such a technological flow in one place. The heart of the city is the Lower V√≠tkovice (DOV), known as Doln√≠ V√≠tkovice. Blast furnaces and other unique machines are placed there. Walking towards the housing part of V√≠tkovice to M√≠rov√© n√°mƒõst√≠, you can find houses, a nursery, a hospital and an old cafeteria and other social buildings build in the 19<sup>th</sup> century by Salomon Mayer von Rothschild after the year 1828. We can find products from V√≠tkovice in Paris ‚Äì Eiffel Tower, or Australia‚Äôs biggest bridge. The production in this place ended in 1998. Since 2007, it has been reused for education, culture, art, conferences and expos, as well as concerts and parties or sports events. Nowadays, Ostrava is known for cultural events, festivals and sports events.</p>

            <h3>Places to visit</h3>

            <p>PyCon CZ will take place at Hlubina ‚Äì the coal mine complex re-made into a cozy conference center.</p>

            <h3>How to get to the venue</h3>

            <p>Both rooms and chill-out zone and more will be at <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/X3PYca4RJw12">Brick House</a> (‚ÄúStar√© koupelny‚Äù in Czech), which is 2-minute walk from the tram stop. Don‚Äôt worry! There will be a navigation to guide you through the area during PyCon&nbsp;CZ.</p>

            <h4>Public transport</h4>
            <p>To search public transport schedules go to <a href="https://jizdnirady.idnes.cz/ostrava/spojeni/">idos.cz</a> or download a mobile app called ‚ÄúJ√≠zdn√≠ ≈ô√°dy IDOS‚Äù (for <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=cz.mafra.jizdnirady">Android</a> or <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/cz/app/j%C3%ADzdn%C3%AD-%C5%99%C3%A1dy-idos/id473503749?mt=8">iOS</a>). Printed schedules are also located at each stop.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><b>Payment card (Visa or Mastercard)</b>: the easiest way! Inside the tram or bus, just tap your card on a yellow machine for a few seconds and wait for the green light. Your ticket is purchased. Anytime you do this, the yellow machines are tracking your card and will use the cheapest price possible for your ticket.</li>
                <li><b>Cash</b>: buy tickets for 30 min, 24 hours or 3 days in yellow ticket machines (located at some tram stops), in newsagent‚Äôs shops. The same ticket is valid for both trams and buses and you can change means of transport within the time period for which your ticket is issued. Don‚Äôt forget to punch (stamp) the ticket right after you enter public transport vehicle if you don‚Äôt have one already stamped and valid on you.</li>
                <li><b>Text message (SMS)</b>: send the text ‚ÄúDPO70‚Äù to 90230. The ticket costs 30 CZK and is valid for 70 minutes. Unfortunately, it works only from Czech phone numbers.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>By car</h4>
            <p>Parking is close to the tram stop <i>Doln√≠ V√≠tkovice Hlubina</i>. Look for the closest point from parking place <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/jFAY7fHwyXG2">V√≠tkovick√° 17</a>, Moravsk√° Ostrava). You can park inside the area for free, around the street Vitkovicka.</p>

            <h4>Bicycle rental</h4>
            <p>You can try ‚ÄúNextbike‚Äù, shared bikes available straight away on streets! Use their app ‚ÄúNextbike‚Äù (download here for <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.nextbike&hl=en">Android</a> or <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/nextbike/id504288371?mt=8">iOS).</a></p>
            <p>And plan your trip on a <a href="https://ostrava.dopracenakole.net/#hledani@trasa=64325101@plan=balanced">specialized map</a> because Google Maps don‚Äôt offer cycling navigation for Ostrava.</p>
            <p>You are looking for <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/jFAY7fHwyXG2">V√≠tkovick√° 17</a> (this is the closest point on the map to reach Star√© koupelny). Park the bike in front of the <i>Cineport</i> building and <i>Kav√°rna Maryƒçka</i>.</p>
