                        We pay with <strong>CZK</strong> (abbr. Kč, “koruna”).
                        <br>ATMs are omnipresent but avoid <i>Euronet</i> because of their high fees.
                        <br>Money exchange booths sometimes offer better deals than banks and no fees, but be cautious which you choose.
                        <br>The exchange rate is approximately 1&nbsp;EUR&nbsp;=&nbsp;25&nbsp;CZK.
