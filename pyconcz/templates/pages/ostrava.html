            <h2>History of Ostrava</h2>

            <p>The old city hall from the 14<sup>th</sup>century was turned to the Ostrava Museum. But the city was built mostly in the 18<sup>th</sup> and 19<sup>th</sup> century when the industrial revolution began. Ostrava was built around one factory, and only a few buildings were there before that. As the main centre of coal mining and coke, iron and steel production in central Europe Ostrava was a unique industrial complex because it was the only area in Europe where you could find such technological flow in one place. Products made in there are part of Paris’ Eiffel Tower, or Australia’s biggest bridge.</p>

            <p>As a key industrial area during communist era, Ostrava was nicknamed “steel heart of the Republic” and socialist realism influenced architecture was built along with parks with fountains, typical plane trees and statues of shining future for working men and women.</p>

            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-lg-6">
                    <p>The unspoiled dominant feature of Ostrava is the Vítkovice area, the <i>Hlubina</i> mine complex, the blast furnaces and the ironworks coke plant which was placed on the tentative list of UNESCO World Heritage Centre.</p>

                    <p>The production ended in 1998 and the city went through a lot of modernisation in the past years. Nowadays, Ostrava is known for cultural events, festivals and sports events: almost every day there’s a new place opening: galleries, cafés, bars or bistros. And people who are very open and direct and very warm at the same time.</p>
